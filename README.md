[![latest](https://github.com/sai-github/nextjs-boilerplate/actions/workflows/main-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sai-github/nextjs-boilerplate/actions/workflows/main-build.yml)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js. We recommend using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions efficiently.
    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```

### Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
-   This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
-   `npm run start`: Runs the built app in production mode.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint and Prettier to lint and fix code.

### Commit Guidelines

-   We use Commitlint to enforce commit message conventions.
-   for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
-   We use github action, so please make sure your commit message is formatted correctly and also provide bundle size information.
